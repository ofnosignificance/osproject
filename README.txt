KotoriOS
--------

Something vaguely resembling something that could be an OS long in the
future. Dedicated to my love Kotori. 

UPDATE: 2026-01-22
------------------
I've been absent from this project for almost 2 months, but now I feel
like doing it again; I work on this when I feel like it, and when I
don't feel like doing it, I will be absent for weeks or months.

This is probably already too much and unwarranted for this mess of code
that barely does anything at all.

I cleaned up some of the old files and am in the process of making the
code more clean, and possibly fixing the million issues it has.
